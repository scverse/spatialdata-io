# Contributing guide

This guide is written for:

- **spatial technology companies** that would like to add a reader for a new product, support a new version of an existing technology, or contribute with edits/bugfixes to one of the available readers
- **academic labs** that would like to contribute a reader for in-house data generation pipelines
- **general users** that would like to improve the library

The `spatialdata-io` repository inherits the technical stack from `spatialdata`, therefore please read also the [contribution guide from the `spatialdata` repository](https://github.com/scverse/spatialdata/blob/main/docs/contributing.md).

The rest of the document will be specific to `spatialdata-io`.

## Adding a new reader

### The reader file

### Separating the constants from the reader logic

## Adding tests: small data vs real data

### When small test datasets are available

### When only real (large) data is available

#### The `download.py` script

#### The `to_zarr.py` script

## What to test

### Testing multiple versions

### Testing plotting capabilities

### Testing data integrity

### Testing auxiliary functions

## Bug tracking

- tracking bugs also outside spatialdata-io
- tracking bugs also in spatialdata

# Limitations

## Unsupported technologies

## Naming constistency across readers
