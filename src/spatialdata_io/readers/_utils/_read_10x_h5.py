    Read 10x-Genomics-formatted hdf5 file.

    Parameters
    ----------
    filename
        Path to a 10x hdf5 file.
    genome
        Filter expression to genes within this genome. For legacy 10x h5
        files, this must be provided if the data contains more than one genome.
    gex_only
        Only keep 'Gene Expression' data and ignore other feature types,
        e.g. 'Antibody Capture', 'CRISPR Guide Capture', or 'Custom'

    Returns
    -------
    Annotated data matrix, where observations/cells are named by their
    barcode and variables/genes by gene name.
    Stores the following information:

        - `~anndata.AnnData.X`: The data matrix is stored
        - `~anndata.AnnData.obs_names`: Cell names
        - `~anndata.AnnData.var_names`: Gene names
        - `['gene_ids']`: Gene IDs
        - `['feature_types']`: Feature types
